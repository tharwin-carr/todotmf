# TODO

A simple todo app built using react hooks.

<strong>Template Used:</strong> https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/tree/master/examples/react-hooks

<strong>A live demo is available at:</strong> https://todotmf.vercel.app/#/

## I added two features to the Todo app:

<ul>
  <li>Added a feature that shows the number of todos in each category
    <ul>
       <li>
         This was a small feature I added just to give a visual of how many tasks there are in each category.         
      </li>      
    </ul>      
  </li>
  <li>Added a feature that allows the user to mark a todo as 'urgent'. 
    If the task is marked as urgent it will appear in the urgent tab and
    also have a red urgent tag next to it.
    <ul>
      <li>
        I added this feature because I like to prioritize my tasks and try to
        complete urgent tasks first. This feature highlights urgent tasks and 
        helps makes them easier to find.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
 </ul>

## My additions to the project:

<ul>
  <li>
    I have a custom css file for the urgent button
  </li>
  <li>
    Added comments explaining the code that I added to the project.
  </li>
  <li>
    Added my credentials at the bottom with a link to my GitHub and LinkedIn
  </li>
</ul>

## Possible Improvements:

  <ul>
    <li>
      For the most part, I kept the CSS the same. I could possibly improve the project by adding a personal styling touch.
    </li>
  </ul>
